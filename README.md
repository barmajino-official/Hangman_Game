# Hangman_Game
Hangman is a classic single-player word guessing game.

In this version of the game, the system chooses a random word from a JSON file that contains three sections: easy, medium, and hard. The player must guess the word by suggesting letters.

The player is allowed a limited number of guesses before the game ends.
The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses.
The player's progress is displayed throughout the game, and the player can view the letters they have already guessed.

Good luck!
